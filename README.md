# Nasdaq
Nasdaq price predictor 

Basic machine learning project that predicts whether nasdaq price will go up or down for the next day. I used rolling averages and other technical analysis as the parameters for my algorithm. Given that this is my first machine learning project, there's still a lot to improve upon with this project. For example, I want to figure out how to use statistical analysis and the alpaca api to increase the accuracy allow the bot to trade by itself.
